[![Circle CI](https://circleci.com/gh/rackspace-orchestration-templates/umbraco-single/tree/master.png?style=shield)](https://circleci.com/gh/rackspace-orchestration-templates/umbraco-single)
Description
===========

This is a template for deploying a Single Windows server running
[Umbraco](http://our.umbraco.org/documentation) on IIS,
ASP .Net 4.5 and with FTP enabled.

Requirements
============
* A Heat provider that supports `Rackspace::Cloud::WinServer`.
* An OpenStack username, password, and tenant id.
* [python-heatclient](https://github.com/openstack/python-heatclient)
`>= v0.2.8`:

```bash
pip install python-heatclient
```

We recommend installing the client within a [Python virtual
environment](http://www.virtualenv.org/).

Example Usage
=============
Here is an example of how to deploy this template using the
[python-heatclient](https://github.com/openstack/python-heatclient):

```
heat --os-username <OS-USERNAME> --os-password <OS-PASSWORD> --os-tenant-id \
  <TENANT-ID> --os-auth-url https://identity.api.rackspacecloud.com/v2.0/ \
  stack-create aspdotnet -f umbraco-app-single.yaml \
  -P server_hostname=my-site -P domain=example.org -P ftp_username=ftp_user
```

* For UK customers, use `https://lon.identity.api.rackspacecloud.com/v2.0/` as
the `--os-auth-url`.

Optionally, set environmental variables to avoid needing to provide these
values every time a call is made:

```
export OS_USERNAME=<USERNAME>
export OS_PASSWORD=<PASSWORD>
export OS_TENANT_ID=<TENANT-ID>
export OS_AUTH_URL=<AUTH-URL>
```

Parameters
==========
Parameters can be replaced with your own values when standing up a stack. Use
the `-P` flag to specify a custom parameter.

* `server_hostname`: Hostname to set for the server (Default: Umbraco)
* `image`: Operating System to use (Default: Windows Server 2008 R2 SP1)
* `flavor`: Server size for your deployment (Default: 4 GB Performance)

Outputs
=======
Once a stack comes online, use `heat output-list` to see all available outputs.
Use `heat output-show <OUTPUT NAME>` to get the value fo a specific output.

* `server_ip`: Public IP of the Windows server.
* `admin_password`: Administrator password for logging into the Windows Server.

Stack Details
=============
#### Getting Started
If you are new to Umbraco, the [Umbraco
Community](http://our.umbraco.org/forum) has great ressources to
get you started. The documentation is available [here](http://our.umbraco.org/documentation).
Umbraco provides [Training and Support](http://umbraco.com/help-and-support.aspx) and their
[Video Library](http://umbraco.com/help-and-support/video-tutorials/getting-started/what-is-umbraco) is very informative.

#### Logging into Umbraco
To login, use the IP address of the server or point an A record to your
server's IP. The domain you provided has also been used to set the [host
file](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/how-do-i-modify-my-hosts-file)
on the server. Therefore you can open a RDP session to the server,
open the domain in the web browser and pursue the last step of the Umbraco
site activation.

#### Additional Licensing
Umbraco is open source under the [MIT
Licence](http://umbraco.com/products/license).

#### Logging in via Remote Desktop
The Administrator password is included in the passwords/secrets section
of this deployment. Use that password and the instructions found
[here](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-to-your-server-via-rdp-windows)
to login and begin managing Umbraco.

#### Uploading Files via FTP
The FTP password is included in the passwords/secrets section
of this deployment. You may use [Filezilla FTP Client](https://filezilla-project.org/)
or [Cyberduck](http://cyberduck.io/) with the FTP credential to upload your application.

#### Details of Your Setup
This setup was built through a [Powershell
Script](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/scriptcenter/dd742419.aspx).
Once the deployment is up, the script will not be run again, so it is
safe to change settings and configurations on your server and within
Umbraco.

#### Post Installation Permissions check
After the deployment, please verify Umbraco permissions check by opening
following the instruction on the following wiki
[article](http://our.umbraco.org/wiki/reference/files-and-folders/permissions/perform-permissions-check).

Contributing
============
There are substantial changes still happening within the [OpenStack
Heat](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Heat) project. Template contribution
guidelines will be drafted in the near future.
